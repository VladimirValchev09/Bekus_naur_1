# Bekus_naur_1
A Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a notation used to formally describe the syntax of programming languages. It uses rules with non-terminal symbols (representing language constructs) and terminal symbols (the actual values or characters in the language) to define how strings in a language are structured.
