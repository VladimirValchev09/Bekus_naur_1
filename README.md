In file bekus_1 you can see a very interesting task which was given by my teacher. This is a way think of BNF as the blueprint for a language 
It’s like a set of instructions that tells you how to build sentences (or code) using building blocks. You start with basic pieces—terms—and then combine them to create more complex structures.
It’s how we make sense of the rules for creating everything from programming languages to the syntax of a secret code!
